This is my first fully functional static web app! I learned a lot about basic DOM manipulation, CSS, and JS functions. This is an idea I've had for quite a while, but I've always given up on it because it was too hard for my then-current skill level. I'm very excited to continue updating this, as well as implementing it within bigger projects. Stay tuned!
